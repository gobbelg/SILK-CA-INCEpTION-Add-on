= Install Java

NOTE: If you aim for a Docker-based deployment, it is useful for you to read the following sections to better understand
      how the overall setup works. However, you will not have to install Java. If you use Docker Compose, you may also not have
      to install a database. Refer to the <<sect_docker>> section instead.

You can install a Java 11 JDK using the following commands.

[source,bash]
----
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
